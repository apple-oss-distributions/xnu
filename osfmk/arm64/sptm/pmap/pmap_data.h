 * Then, for any instance in which the pmap needs to retype a page without being
 * otherwise guaranteed (e.g. by VM layer locking or the existing page type) that such
 * a sensitive operation is not in progress on some other CPU, it must drain these
 * sensitive operations from other CPUs.  Specifically, it must ensure that any
 * sensitive operation which may have observed prior mapping state of the page that
 * is to be retyped has completed.  This is accomplished by first calling
 * pmap_retype_epoch_prepare_drain() to record the initial retype epoch state of
 * all CPUs, followed by pmap_retype_epoch_drain() to ensure all remote CPUs are
 * either not in an epoch or have advanced beyond the initially recorded epoch.
 * These are exposed as two separate functions in order to allow the calling CPU
 * to do other work between calling pmap_retype_epoch_prepare_drain() and
 * pmap_retype_epoch_drain(), as a best-effort attempt to minimize time wasted
 * spinning in pmap_retype_epoch_drain().
 *
 * When draining the retype epoch, the following assumptions must hold true:
 *
 * 1) The calling thread must guarantee that prior updates needed to bring the page
 * into the correct mapping state for retyping have already been performed and made
 * globally visible using the appropriate barriers.  In most cases this means that
 * all existing mappings of the page must have been removed.  For any alterations
 * of mapping state, global visibility is conveniently already guaranteed by the
 * DSBs that are architecturally required to synchronize PTE updates and the TLBIs
 * that follow them.
 *
 * 2) The calling thread must have some means of ensuring the new mappings cannot
 * be added for the page that would bring it out of the correct state for retyping.
 * This is typically done by holding the PVH lock and/or the exclusive pmap lock
 * such that pmap_enter() cannot concurrently execute against the page.
 *
 * 3) The calling thread must not perform any operation which requires preemptibility
 * between calling pmap_retype_epoch_prepare_drain() and pmap_retype_epoch_drain().
